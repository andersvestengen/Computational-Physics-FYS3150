### Computational Physics 1 m/ Anders Vestengen, Sakarias Frette og William Hirst
This is the repository for the course Fys3150 Computational Physics Fall 2020. 
Each project has its own folder, with scripts to run and a scientific report. All computation is done in C++, compiled in C++17 with Clang version 4.0.1, and visualized and or analysed in Python 3.7.6. For better oversight, each folder has a makefile, containing commands for compiling and executing the code.
